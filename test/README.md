This directory contains a couple small fasta files with nucleotide and protein sequences from the NCBI Alphainfluenzavirus segment 4 RefSeq sequences.  These serve as small positive control datasets for this workflow that can be run using the [run_test](../run_test) command or [run_test_github](../run_test_github) command.  The former runs a local test if you've downloaded or cloned the repository and the latter will run using code from github.
